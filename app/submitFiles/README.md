The team did a large amount of development from scratch and the majority, if not all, of the code within each file in this folder was developed by the team. We utilized many ideas and practices of the Flask framework to properly integrate the model, view and controller, but we developed this to meet our needs. The templates and static directories are the only subdirectories of the main folder and should contain more project files. If for some reason the contents of these folders did not submit then please let us know and we will be sure to get those to you. If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to ask and we all thank you so much for a wonderful semester!
