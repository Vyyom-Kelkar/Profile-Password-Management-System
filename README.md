# OSU AU17 CSE 4471 Project

For this project, our team decided to create a password similarity and security system. The goal
of this project was to develop a user profile password management system that would provide an
enhanced level of security as well as features that could be easily incorporated into many infrastructures.
We accomplished this goal and created the Password Similarity and Security System that allows
administrators to create companies and manage the password requirements for all employees that
belong to the company. Our project had many complex features such as a password strength bar that
tells a user how secure their password is when they are creating an account or changing their current
password. We also implemented a similarity algorithm so that a user cannot change their password to
one that is similar to any of their previous passwords or to a password that we have labeled as “too
common”. In addition to this, we used a one-way hash and only sent hashed data to our database
meaning that passwords never appeared as plain text. Finally we included an option so that if the user
forgets their password, he or she has a forgotten password option that allows them to securely recover
their account. All of these functionalities were accessible through a beautiful and intuitive website.
